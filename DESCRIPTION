Description: Functions are designed to facilitate access to and utility with large scale, publicly available environmental data in R. The package contains functions for downloading (download_data()) raw data files from web URLs, processing (process_covariates()) the raw data files into clean spatial objects, and extracting values (calc_covariates()) from the spatial data objects at point and polygon locations. These functions call a series of source-specific functions which are tailored to each data sources/datasets particular URL structure, data format, and spatial/temporal resolution. amadeus functions are tested, versioned, and open source and open access.
