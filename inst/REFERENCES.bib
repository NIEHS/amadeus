We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.}

The V-criteria (volume, variety, velocity and veracity, etc) for defining big data have been well-known and even quoted in most research articles; however, big data research into public health is often misrepresented due to certain common misconceptions. Such misrepresentations and misconceptions would mislead study designs, research findings and healthcare decision-making. This study aims to identify the V-eligibility of big data studies and their technologies applied to environmental health and health services research that explicitly claim to be big data studies.Methods and analysis Our protocol follows Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Scoping review and/or systematic review will be conducted. The results will be reported using PRISMA for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), or PRISMA 2020 and Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guideline. Web of Science, PubMed, Medline and ProQuest Central will be searched for the articles from the database inception to 2021. Two reviewers will independently select eligible studies and extract specified data. The numeric data will be analysed with R statistical software. The text data will be analysed with NVivo wherever applicable.Ethics and dissemination This study will review the literature of big data research related to both environmental health and health services. Ethics approval is not required as all data are publicly available and involves confidential personal data. We will disseminate our findings in a peer-reviewed journal.PROSPERO registration number CRD42021202306.},

Amongst human-modified environmental hazards, air pollution has been identified as the world’s largest killer, being responsible for an estimated 6.4 million deaths per year (1 in 9 deaths).1 According to the World Health Organization, two billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds recommended international limits and 300 million children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds six times those international limits. Other hazards of the human-modified environment include water pollutants, such as chemicals and microplastics; radiation from mobile phones, powerlines or nearby nuclear installations; and soil contaminants such as heavy metals.}},

This paper outlines the challenges and opportunities presented by advances in data collection, storage, analysis, and access, particularly focusing on “data mashups”. These data mashups are integrations of different types and sources of data, frequently using open application programming interfaces and data sources, to produce enriched results that were not necessarily the original reason for assembling the raw source data. As an illustration of this potential, this paper describes a recently funded initiative to create such a facility in the UK for use in decision support around climate change and health, and provides examples of suitable sources of data and the purposes to which they can be directed, particularly for policy makers and public health decision makers.}

The package facilitates the downloading and processing of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures for Europe from 1950 to 2020. Using easyclimate and given a set of coordinates (points or polygons) and dates (days or years), the user can download the climatic information as a tidy table or a raster object. In this package we implemented Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs which provide access to daily climate data for thousands of sites/days, without having to download huge rasters. Daily climate data are not available in many of the current climate databases and are essential for many research questions and applications in environmental modelling, forestry, and ecological and vegetation studies across Europe.}

	abstract = {Abstract
            In support of the environmental justice (EJ) movement, researchers, activists, and policymakers often use environmental data to document evidence of the unequal distribution of environmental burdens and benefits along lines of race, class, and other socioeconomic characteristics. Numerous limitations, such as spatial or temporal discontinuities, exist with commonly used data measurement techniques, which include ground monitoring and federal screening tools. Satellite data is well poised to address these gaps in EJ measurement and monitoring; however, little is known about how satellite data has advanced findings in EJ or can help to promote EJ through interventions. Thus, this scoping review aims to (1) explore trends in study design, topics, geographic scope, and satellite datasets used to research EJ, (2) synthesize findings from studies that use satellite data to characterize disparities and inequities across socio-demographic groups for various environmental categories, and (3) capture how satellite data are relevant to policy and real-world impact. Following PRISMA extension guidelines for scoping reviews, we retrieved 81 articles that applied satellite data for EJ research in the United States from 2000 to 2022. The majority of the studies leveraged the technical advantages of satellite data to identify socio-demographic disparities in exposure to environmental risk factors, such as air pollution, and access to environmental benefits, such as green space, at wider coverage and with greater precision than previously possible. These disparities in exposure and access are associated with health outcomes such as increased cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, mental illness, and mortality. Research using satellite data to illuminate EJ concerns can contribute to efforts to mitigate environmental inequalities and reduce health disparities. Satellite data for EJ research can therefore support targeted interventions or influence planning and policy changes, but significant work remains to facilitate the application of satellite data for policy and community impact.},

	abstract = {Larger and more severe wildfires are becoming more frequent and impacting different communities and human settlements. Much of the scientific literature and media on wildfires has focused on area of ecosystems burned and numbers of structures destroyed. Equally unprecedented, but often less reported, are the increasing socioeconomic impacts different people and communities face from wildfires. Such information seems to indicate an emerging need to account for wildfire effects on peri-urban or wildland urban interface (WUI) areas, newer socio-demographic groups, and disadvantaged communities. To address this, we reviewed the socio-demographic dimensions of the wildfire literature using an environmental justice (EJ) lens. Specifically using a literature review of wildfires, human communities, social vulnerability, and homeowner mitigation, we conducted bibliometric and statistical analyses of 299 publications. The majority of publications were from the United States, followed by Canada and Australia, and most dealt with homeowner mitigation of risk, defensible space, and fuel treatments in WUI areas. Most publications studied the direct effects of wildfire related damage. Secondary impacts such as smoke, rural and urban communities, and the role of poverty and language were less studied. Based on a proposed wildfire-relevant EJ definition, the first EJ publication was in 2004, but the term was first used as a keyword in 2018. Studies in WUI communities statistically decreased the likelihood that a publication was EJ relevant. There was a significant relationship between EJ designation and inclusion of race/ethnicity and poverty variables in the study. Complexity across the various definitions of EJ suggest that it should not be used as a quantitative or binary metric; but as a lens to better understand socio-ecological impacts to diverse communities. We present a wildfire-relevant definition to potentially guide policy formulation and account for social and environmental justice issues.},

All country road networks have been joined topologically at the borders, and many countries have been edited for internal topology. Source data for each country are provided in the documentation, and users are encouraged to refer to the readme file for use constraints that apply to a small number of countries. Because the data are compiled from multiple sources, the date range for road network representations ranges from the 1980s to 2010 depending on the country (most countries have no confirmed date), and spatial accuracy varies. The baseline global data set was compiled by the Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS) of the University of Georgia. Updated data for 27 countries and 6 smaller geographic entities were assembled by Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), with a focus largely on developing countries with the poorest data coverage.},

              We introduce Version 2 of our widely used 1-km Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps for historical and future climate conditions. The historical maps (encompassing 1901–1930, 1931–1960, 1961–1990, and 1991–2020) are based on high-resolution, observation-based climatologies, while the future maps (encompassing 2041–2070 and 2071–2099) are based on downscaled and bias-corrected climate projections for seven shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). We evaluated 67 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and kept a subset of 42 with the most plausible CO
              2
              -induced warming rates. We estimate that from 1901–1930 to 1991–2020, approximately 5\% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) transitioned to a different major Köppen-Geiger class. Furthermore, we project that from 1991–2020 to 2071–2099, 5\% of the land surface will transition to a different major class under the low-emissions SSP1-2.6 scenario, 8\% under the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 13\% under the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario. The Köppen-Geiger maps, along with associated confidence estimates, underlying monthly air temperature and precipitation data, and sensitivity metrics for the CMIP6 models, can be accessed at

A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells. The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count raster for a given target year by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second count data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions to produce density rasters at these resolutions.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released five National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 release saw landcover created for additional years of 2003, 2008, and 2013. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2019. The NLCD 2019 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91\% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91\% accuracy in overall developed. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2019 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2019 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

              The Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS‐CF) system is a high‐resolution (0.25°) global constituent prediction system from NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). GEOS‐CF offers a new tool for atmospheric chemistry research, with the goal to supplement NASA's broad range of space‐based and in‐situ observations. GEOS‐CF expands on the GEOS weather and aerosol modeling system by introducing the GEOS‐Chem chemistry module to provide hindcasts and 5‐days forecasts of atmospheric constituents including ozone (O
              3
              ), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO
              2
              ), sulfur dioxide (SO
              2
              ), and fine particulate matter (PM
              2.5
              ). The chemistry module integrated in GEOS‐CF is identical to the offline GEOS‐Chem model and readily benefits from the innovations provided by the GEOS‐Chem community. Evaluation of GEOS‐CF against satellite, ozonesonde and surface observations for years 2018–2019 show realistic simulated concentrations of O
              3
              , NO
              2
              , and CO, with normalized mean biases of −0.1 to 0.3, normalized root mean square errors between 0.1–0.4, and correlations between 0.3–0.8. Comparisons against surface observations highlight the successful representation of air pollutants in many regions of the world and during all seasons, yet also highlight current limitations, such as a global high bias in SO
              2
              and an overprediction of summertime O
              3
              over the Southeast United States. GEOS‐CF v1.0 generally overestimates aerosols by 20\%–50\% due to known issues in GEOS‐Chem v12.0.1 that have been addressed in later versions. The 5‐days forecasts have skill scores comparable to the 1‐day hindcast. Model skills can be improved significantly by applying a bias‐correction to the surface model output using a machine‐learning approach.

            Plain Language Summary
            
              Accurate forecasting of the compostion of the atmosphere is important for a variety of applications, including air pollution mitigation, support of satellite and other remote‐sensing observations, and research applications. Producing such forecasts is computationally expensive due to the complexity of atmospheric chemistry, which interacts with weather on all scales. Here we present the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS‐CF) system, which produces global forecasts of major atmospheric constituents such as ozone (O
              3
              ), nitrogen dioxide (NO
              2
              ), and fine particulate matter (PM
              2.5
              ). On a daily basis, the model tracks the atmospheric concentrations of more than 250 chemical species in more than 55 million model grid cells, computing the interactions between those species using the state‐of‐the‐science GEOS‐Chem chemistry model. We present an in‐depth evaluation of the GEOS‐CF model through comparison against independent observations. We show how the model captures many observed features of atmospheric composition, such as spatio‐temporal variations in air pollution due to changes in pollutant emissions, weather, and chemistry. We also highlight some of the model deficiencies, for example, with respect to the simulation of aerosol particles. Finally, we demonstrate how surface observations and model data can be combined using machine learning to provide improved local air quality forecasts.
