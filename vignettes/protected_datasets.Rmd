The `download_data` function from `amadeus` provides access to a variety of publicly available environmental data sources.
Although publicly available, certain data sources are protected and require users to provide login credentials before accessing and downloading the data.
Datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), for example, require users to have and provide credentials for a NASA EarthData account.
Manually downloading data from the web while logged into a NASA EarthData Account will automatically reference the user's credentials, but accessing data via the `download_data` function requires "prerequiste files" which store user credentials.

## Motivation

This vignette will demonstrate how to create and log into a NASA EarthData Account, and how to generate the prerequisite files with R code.

## NASA EarthData Account

Visit [https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/](http://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) to register for or log into a NASA EarthData account.

![NASA EarthData Account Landing Page](images/NASA_EarthData_login.png)

Account registration provides access to NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) and its twelve Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC), including:

-   Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) DAAC
-   Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC)
-   Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS)
-   Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center (GHRC)
-   Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC)
-   Land Processes DAAC (LP DAAC)
-   Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) DAAC
-   National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) DAAC
-   Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) DAAC
-   Ocean Biology DAAC (OB.DAAC)
-   Physical Oceanography DAAC (PO.DAAC)
-   Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)

See <https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs> for more information.

### Approved applications

After creating an account, navigate to "My Profile"(https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile), and then to "Applications \> Authorized Apps". This "Authorized Apps" page specifies which NASA EarthData applications can use your login credentials. For this example, ensure that authorization is enabled for "SEDAC Website", "SEDAC Website (Alpha)", and "SEDAC Website (Beta)".

## Prerequisite files

With a NASA EarthData Account and the required applications authorized to use the credentials, it is time to create the prerequisite files.
The following examples will utilize the [UN WPP-Adjusted population density data from NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4/united-nations-adjusted).

Before generating the prerequisite, try to download the population data with `download_data`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download_data(
  dataset_name = "sedac_population",
  year = "2020",
  data_format = "GeoTIFF",
  data_resolution = "60 minute",
  directory_to_save = "./sedac_population",
  acknowledgement = TRUE,
  download = TRUE,
  unzip = TRUE,
  remove_zip = FALSE,
  remove_command = TRUE
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
to_cat <-
  paste0(
    "Downloading requested files...\n",
    "Requested files have been downloaded.\n",
    "Unzipping files...\n\n",
    "Warning in unzip(file_name, exdir = directory_to_unzip): ",
    "error 1 in extracting from zip file\n\n",
    "Files unzipped and saved in ./sedac_population/.\n\n"
  )
cat(to_cat)
```

As the error message indicates, the downloaded file cannot be unzipped because the data file was not accessed properly.
To be able to download protected NASA data with `download_data`, the `.netrc`, `.urs_cookies`, and `.dodsrc` must be generated.

**Note** The following code has been adopted from [How to Generate Earthdata Prerequisite Files](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto?title=How%20to%20Generate%20Earthdata%20Prerequisite%20Files) on NASA GES DISC's ["How-To's" webpage](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto).

**The folowing steps assume a Mac or Linux operating system. Instructions for generating prerequisite files on Windows operating system in R is being developed.**

### `.netrc`

The following commands create the `.netrc` file, which contains your NASA EarthData Account credentials.

First, set your working directory to the home directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/")
```

Create a file named `.netrc` with `file.create`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.create(".netrc")
```

Open a connection to `.netrc` with `sink`. Write the line `machine urs...` replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your NASA EarthData username and password, respectively. After writing the line, close the connection with `sink` again. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sink(".netrc")
writeLines(
  "machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login YOUR_USERNAME password YOUR_PASSWORD"
)
sink()
```

Edit the settings so only you, the owner of the file, can read and write `.netrc`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system("chmod 0600 .netrc")
```

After, check to ensure the file was created properly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.exists(".netrc")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
TRUE
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
readLines(".netrc")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
paste0(
  "machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login YOUR_USERNAME password YOUR_PASSWORD"
)
```

### `.urs_cookies`

The following commands create the `.urs_cookies` file.

First, set your working directory to the home directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/")
```

Create a file named `.netrc` with `file.create`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.create(".urs_cookies")
```

After, check to ensure the file was created properly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.exists(".urs_cookies")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
TRUE
```

### `.dodsrc`

The following commands create the `.urs_cookies` file.

First, set your working directory to the home directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/")
```

Create a file named ".dodsrc" with `file.create`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.create(".dodsrc")
```

Open a connection to `.dodsrc` with `sink`. Write the lines beginning with `HTTP.`, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your NASA EarthData username and password, respectively. After writing the line, close the connection with `sink` again. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sink(".dodsrc")
writeLines(
  paste0(
    "HTTP.NETRC=YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.netrc\n",
    "HTTP.COOKIE.JAR=YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.urs_cookies"
  )
)
sink()
```

After, check to ensure the file was created properly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.exists(".dodsrc")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
TRUE
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
readLines(".dodsrc")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
paste0(
  c(
    "HTTP.NETRC=YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.netrc",
    "HTTP.COOKIE.JAR=YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.urs_cookies"
  )
)
```

It is important to ensure that these commands, as well as your username, password, and home directory, are typed without error, as a single problem with any of these files will result in a failed download.
If the files have been created correctly, the UN WPP-Adjusted population density data from NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) will be downloaded and unzipped without returning an error.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download_data(
  dataset_name = "sedac_population",
  year = "2020",
  data_format = "GeoTIFF",
  data_resolution = "60 minute",
  directory_to_save = "./sedac_population",
  acknowledgement = TRUE,
  download = TRUE,
  unzip = TRUE,
  remove_zip = FALSE,
  remove_command = TRUE
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
to_cat <-
  paste0(
    "Downloading requested files...\n",
    "Requested files have been downloaded.\n",
    "Unzipping files...\n",
    "Files unzipped and saved in ./sedac_population/.\n"
  )
cat(to_cat)
```

Check the downloaded data files.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list.files("./sedac_population")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sedac_files <- c(
  paste0(
    "gpw_v4_population_density_adjusted_to_2015_unwpp_country_totals_",
    "rev11_2020_1_deg_tif_readme.txt"
  ),
  paste0(
    "gpw_v4_population_density_adjusted_to_2015_unwpp_country_totals_",
    "rev11_2020_1_deg_tif.zip"
  ),
  paste0(
    "gpw_v4_population_density_adjusted_to_2015_unwpp_country_totals_",
    "rev11_2020_1_deg.tif"
  )
)
sedac_files
```

As indicated by the files in `./sedac_population`, the data files have been downloaded properly.
